# LCoder IDE Advanced Improvements Summary

I have further enhanced the LCoder IDE with professional-grade features that significantly improve productivity and customization.

## 1. Multi-Tab Editor Support
- **Simultaneous Editing**: You can now open multiple files at once. Each file is managed in its own tab within the "Editors" section.
- **Tab Management**: Added shortcuts for tab operations: `Ctrl+N` (New File), `Ctrl+O` (Open File), `Ctrl+W` (Close Tab), and `Ctrl+S` (Save).
- **Independent State**: Each tab maintains its own language settings, undo history, and cursor position.

## 2. Advanced Code Navigation
- **Bracket Matching**: When the cursor is placed next to a bracket `(`, `[`, or `{`, the IDE automatically highlights its corresponding pair. This makes navigating complex nested code much easier.
- **Enhanced Highlighting**: Improved the syntax highlighting engine to be more robust and handle multi-tab environments efficiently.

## 3. Theme Editor & Customization
- **Live Theme Editor**: Added a new "Theme Editor" accessible via the "Theme" menu. It allows you to customize every color in the IDE (backgrounds, foregrounds, syntax colors) and apply them instantly.
- **Custom Themes**: You can now create a "custom" theme that persists during your session.

## 4. UI & UX Polish
- **Refined Layout**: The UI has been reorganized to use nested tabs, separating the editing area from the output and terminal for a cleaner workspace.
- **Improved Shortcuts**: Standardized keyboard shortcuts for a more familiar IDE experience.

These advanced features bring LCoder closer to modern professional editors like VS Code or Sublime Text, providing a powerful yet lightweight development environment.
